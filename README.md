# 🩺 Healthcare VR Application

The **Healthcare VR App** is an immersive Virtual Reality experience developed in Unity that allows users to explore human anatomy and medical environments in a realistic, interactive way. Designed for educational, simulation, and demonstration purposes, this VR application brings critical aspects of healthcare — like anatomy exploration, operation theatre walkthroughs, and lab interaction — into a virtual 3D space.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This application is aimed at students, educators, healthcare trainers, and curious minds who want to experience medical learning in an engaging and futuristic format. The app provides a hands-on, close-up view of the human body's internal organs and typical healthcare environments through a VR headset.

Whether you're studying biology, teaching human anatomy, or demonstrating a medical process in a seminar — this project is a useful tool to simulate real-world scenarios without needing physical setups.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔬 Human Anatomy Exploration
- Detailed 3D models of essential organs such as:
  - ❤️ Heart
  - 🫁 Lungs
  - 🧠 Brain
- Each organ is modeled for realism and positioned in a way to allow 360° inspection in VR.

### 🏥 Operation Theatre Simulation
- A virtual surgical room setup including surgical tables, lighting, and medical equipment.
- Interactive environment to help users experience the look and feel of an actual OT.

### 🧪 Medical Laboratory Environment
- Users can move around a virtual lab and interact with equipment (microscopes, test tubes, etc.).
- Educational tool to understand medical lab environments without real-world constraints.

### 🕹️ VR Controls
- Uses XR Interaction Toolkit or Oculus SDK for:
  - Teleportation
  - Object grabbing and inspection
  - Smooth VR locomotion and interaction
